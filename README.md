# QW App

> A new way to play and watch QW games.

## Features

- On Demmand servers: instead of wasting resources with tons of empty servers running 24/h, players will be able to
  request a server and start playing in any local region of the world within a couple of minutes.

- Match Maker: ever felt like you're wasting a lifetime in QW pre-wars? Just let other players know what you're up to
  and get notified when the game is set so you can join a fresh server waiting for you to ready up.

- Scheduled games: always busy? Schedule your QW games! Invite your friends to join you for a QW session in the future,
  get reminders and notifications regarding the event and a server set up for you and your friends to play.
